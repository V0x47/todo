# TODO

This is a small project where I implement a simple TODO command-line interface (CLI) in different programming languages.
The goal is to explore language features, compare approaches, and have fun building the same tool across ecosystems.

## Structure

Each language has its own subdirectory:

- `rust/` – Rust implementation
- `c/` – C implementation

## Features

- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Edit already added task
- Mark tasks as done
- Remove tasks
- Save/load from file (optional per implementation)
